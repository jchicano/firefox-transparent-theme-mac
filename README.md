Two line version: As I'm not going to use it, I decided to not include it. Remains in the original repository

Startpage I am using: [Bonjourr](https://github.com/victorazevedo-me/Bonjourr)

I commented ``` /* Modification v75 */ ``` where I changed code for FF75

This file also includes some improvements I like, such as:
* Showing close tab button on hover
* Hiding extension name in searchbar unless you hover
* Removed back button background circle
